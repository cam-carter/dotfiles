# Cam Carter's dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfile configurations. It also contains a deployment script to install Vim, zsh, and tmux, if you do not have them already. The included software and there configuration files are meant to be a lightweight toolkit usable on any UNIX-based machine.

To deploy clone the repo into your `$HOME` directory and run the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cam-carter/dotfiles
$ cd dotfiles && ./deploy
```
